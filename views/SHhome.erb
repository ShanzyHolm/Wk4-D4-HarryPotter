      <h3>
        While still alive the four founders did divide<br>
        Their favourites from the throng,<br>
        Yet how to pick the worthy ones<br>
        When they were dead and gone?<br>
        <br><br>
        'Twas Gryffindor who found the way,<br>
        He whipped me off his head<br>
        The founders put some brains in me<br>
        So I could choose instead!<br>
        <br><br>
        Now slip me snug around your ears,<br>
        I've never yet been wrong,<br>
        I'll have alook inside your mind<br>
        And tell where you belong!
